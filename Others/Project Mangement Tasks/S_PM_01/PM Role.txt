2-make sure that every member knows what exactly what his/her task is
3-regular follow up on members to make sure that they are on track and to help them if there's a problem
4-make sure to solve any problem or challenge arises which will lead to miss for the deadline
5-put a solid communication system between him/her and the team members and between the team members and each other.
6-try to motivate the members in downs and award or praise thier work in ups to keep motivated.
